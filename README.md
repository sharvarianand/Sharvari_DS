This repository contains a collection of **experiments** performed during the Data Structures lab as well as a **course project**. The focus of this repository is on fundamental data structures, their implementation, and use cases. Note that this repository primarily covers data structures and not algorithms.

# Contents
The repository is organized into two main sections:

Lab Experiments:

A set of experiments focused on the implementation and understanding of various data structures.
Topics include:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hashing Techniques
- Heaps

Course Project:
A comprehensive project that applies multiple data structures to solve a real-world problem.
The project emphasizes the practical application of data structures in solving complex issues.
